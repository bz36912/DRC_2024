"""Ib is doing it
It is for visualising the data, which help us to debug and develop the data processing and
self-driving algorithm.
It helps us to see what the car is seeing so we can better understand its behaviour.
The GUI shows:
    - the raw video feed
    - annotated feed with contours/outlines from colour masking
    - after perspective transform and an arrow showing the direction (angle) and speed (length of arrow)
        the path planner directs the car to drive in
